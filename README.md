# Gemification

A Slack bot built on [BotKit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) created for UW-Oshkosh central IT as a buddy reward system. Give gems to coworkers for to show workplace appreciation!

## Permissions

There are two permissions in this program: **user** and **admin**.

#### User

This permission can give gems to co-workers in the Slack team and view the leaderboard.

#### Admin

This permission has all the permissions of the user as well as admin functionality. They are as follows:

- Clear the leaderboard
- List the current Gemification admins
- Add a new Gemification admin
- Remove an existing Gemification admin
- Get a full list of all gems given in the current time period
- Show a list of gem statements (reasons) for a Gemification user
- List all currently configured Gemification users and which group (leaderboard) they are assigned to
- Reconfigure an existing (or new) Gemification user to a new group (leaderboard)

#### Additional Note

For each admin role, you can private message the Gemification bot in Slack "help" to receive a list of all commands you have access to perform at your currently assigned permission level.

## Usage

To give someone a gem, simply type @<insert slack username here> followed by :gem: <insert reason>

#### Giving Gems Examples

- @Aaron.Rodgers ðŸ’Ž for throwing that Super Bowl touchdown pass!
- @Mike.McCarthy ðŸ’Ž for cracking down on missed tackles in practice today.

Each gem statement will give one gem to each tagged person. Gems are tracked in a leaderboard, showing who has the most gems.

To access this leaderboard, go to the #gem-appreciation channel and type @gemification leaderboard.

If @Aaron.Rodgers and @Mike.McCarthy were each on the Green Bay Packers team in Slack, the leaderboard would look like this after both of the previous Gem transactions.

Green Bay Packers Leaderboard:
> 1.) Aaron.Rodgers 1

> 2.) Mike.McCarthy 1
